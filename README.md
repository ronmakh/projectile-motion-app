# Projectile Motion App

This repository contains an app designed for interactive learning on the projectile motion theory through explanation of the teory, an integractive game and conclusion (theory explanation and game/demo instructions are shown in app)

App is developed using Python 2.7, and UI developed using the Tkinter built-in package

## How to run

1. Install Python 2.7
2. Go to app directory and run following command:
``` python projectile_app.py '''

## Development history

This app was the first app developed by the author whilst studying for his mechanical engineering foundation year at university (year 2016)

App was designed as an interactive tool to teach about projectile motion, which is a classic mechanical engineering theory.

App is no longer maintained by the user (hence lack of code cleanliness from a real noob back then). Fret not, the app is working fine and feel free to give it a try!
